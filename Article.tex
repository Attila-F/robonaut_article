% Style Guide:
% Technologies: Enclose them with \verb!name! e.g.: \verb!MATLAB!
% Important anocryms, titles, etc: Enclose them in \textbf{name} to get bold typeface. e.g. \textbf{RobonAUT}
% Emphasis: No italics, the text should be composed well so emphasis is obvious. Italics are for definitions and anocryms [stanford paper guide]

\begin{abstract}
RobonAUT is a local robot development contest of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of BME. This paper describes the development process of an Autonomous Ground Vehicle which was one of the successful competitors of the 2014 contest. During software development of the embedded control system the possibilities of rapid prototyping have been exploited extensively. The paper demonstrates the power of model based design of control systems and embedded software, and describes the rapid deployment method in detail, which was used to integrate the MATLAB model with FreeRTOS on the target hardware.
