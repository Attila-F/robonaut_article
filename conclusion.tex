\section{Results and future work}

The most important result is the successful application of the method. The system was designed and implemented in \verb!MATLAB!-generated code embedded into a \verb!FreeRTOS! Core, based on the methods described in this paper. Despite the odds and a challenging competition during the RobonAUT 2014, our car have scored a podium finish. It demonstrated complete reliability, though there have been performance issues in the faster sections, due to a flaw in the controller design. We plan to participate in the RobonAUT 2015 competition as well, and utilize the direct hardware support of \verb!MATLAB! for the \verb!STM32F4-Discovery!.
