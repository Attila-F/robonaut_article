\section{Conclusion and future work}

The most important result is the successful application of the method. The system was designed and implemented in \textsf{MATLAB}-generated code integrated with a \textsf{FreeRTOS} Core, based on the methods described in this paper. Despite the odds and a challenging competition during the \textbf{RobonAUT 2014}, our car have scored a podium finish. It demonstrated complete reliability, though there have been stability issues in the faster sections, due to a flaw in the controller design. We plan to participate in the \textbf{RobonAUT 2015} competition as well, and utilize the direct hardware support of \textsf{MATLAB} for the \textsf{STM32F4-Discovery}, to improve the performance both of the vehicle and team.
